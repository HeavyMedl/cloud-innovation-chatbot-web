## Migrating from Web Chat v3 to v4

There are three possible paths that migration might take when migrating from v3 to v4. First, please compare your beginning scenario:

### My current website integrate Web Chat using an `<iframe>` element obtained from Azure Bot Services. I want to upgrade to v4.

Starting from May 2019, we are rolling out v4 to websites that integrate Web Chat using `<iframe>` element. Please refer to [the embed documentation](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/treemaster/packages/embed/README.md) for information on integrating Web Chat using `<iframe>`.

### My website is integrated with Web Chat v3 and uses customization options provided by Web Chat, no customization at all, or very little of my own customization that was not available with Web Chat.

Please follow the implementation of sample [`01.c.getting-started-migration`](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/tree/master/samples/01.c.getting-started-migration) to convert your webpage from v3 to v4 of Web Chat.

### My website is integrated with a fork of Web Chat v3. I have implemented a lot of customization in my version of Web Chat, and I am concerned v4 is not compatible with my needs.

One of our team's favorite things about v4 of Web Chat is the ability to add customization **without the need to fork Web Chat**. Although this creates additional overhead for v3 users who forked Web Chat previously, we will do our best to support customers making the bump. Please use the following suggestions:

- Take a look at the implementation of sample [`01.c.getting-started-migration`](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/tree/master/samples/01.c.getting-started-migration). This is a great starting place to get Web Chat up and running.
- Next, please go through the [samples list](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/tree/master/samples) to compare your customization requirements to what Web Chat has already provided support for. These samples are made up of commonly asked-for features for Web Chat.
- If one or more of your features is not available in the samples, please look through our [open and closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+), [Samples label](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3ASample), and the [Migration Support label](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/issues?q=is%3Aissue+migrate+label%3A%22Migration+Support%22) to search for sample requests and/or customization support for a feature you are looking for. Adding your comment to open issues will help the team prioritize requests that are in high demand, and we encourage participation in our community.
- If you did not find your feature in the list of open requests, please feel free to [file your own request](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/issues/new). Just like the item above, other customers adding comments to your open issue will help us prioritize which features are most commonly needed across Web Chat users.
- Finally, if you need your feature as soon as possible, we welcome [pull requests](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/compare) to Web Chat. If you have the coding experience to implement the feature yourself, we would very much appreciate the additional support! Creating the feature yourself will mean that it is available for your use on Web Chat more quickly, and that other customers looking for the same or similar feature may utilize your contribution.
- Make sure to check out the rest of this `README` to learn more about v4.

# How to use

> For previous versions of Web Chat (v3), visit the [Web Chat v3 branch](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/tree/v3).

First, create a bot using [Azure Bot Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/bot-service/).
Once the bot is created, you will need to [obtain the bot's Web Chat secret](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-channel-connect-webchat?view=azure-bot-service-3.0#step-1) in Azure Portal. Then use the secret to [generate a token](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/rest-api/bot-framework-rest-direct-line-3-0-authentication?view=azure-bot-service-4.0) and pass it to your Web Chat.

Here is how how you can add Web Chat control to your website:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <div id="webchat" role="main"></div>
    <script src="https://cdn.botframework.com/botframework-webchat/latest/webchat.js"></script>
    <script>
      window.WebChat.renderWebChat({
        directLine: window.WebChat.createDirectLine({ token: 'YOUR_DIRECT_LINE_TOKEN' }),
        userID: 'YOUR_USER_ID',
        username: 'Web Chat User',
        locale: 'en-US',
        botAvatarInitials: 'WC',
        userAvatarInitials: 'WW'
      }, document.getElementById('webchat'));
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```
> `userID`, `username`, `locale`, `botAvatarInitials`, and `userAvatarInitials` are all optional parameters to pass into the `renderWebChat` method. To learn more about Web Chat props, look at the [Web Chat API Reference](#web-chat-api-reference) section of this `README`.

## Integrate with JavaScript

Web Chat is designed to integrate with your existing web site using JavaScript or React. Integrating with JavaScript will give you moderate styling and customizability.

### Full bundle

You can use the full, typical webchat package that contains the most typically used features.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <div id="webchat" role="main"></div>
    <script src="https://cdn.botframework.com/botframework-webchat/latest/webchat.js"></script>
    <script>
      window.WebChat.renderWebChat({
        directLine: window.WebChat.createDirectLine({ token: 'YOUR_DIRECT_LINE_TOKEN' }),
        userID: 'YOUR_USER_ID'
      }, document.getElementById('webchat'));
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

See the working sample of the [full Web Chat bundle](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/tree/master/samples/01.a.getting-started-full-bundle).

### Minimal bundle

Instead of using the full, typical package of Web Chat, you can choose a lighter-weight sample with fewer features. This bundle does **not** contain:
- Adaptive Cards
- Cognitive Services
- Markdown-It

Since Adaptive Cards is not included in this bundle, rich cards that depend on Adaptive Cards will not render, e.g. hero cards, receipt cards, etc. A list of attachments that are not supported without Adaptive Cards can be found on the [`createAdaptiveCardMiddleware.js` file](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/tree/master/packages/component/src/Middleware/Attachment/createAdaptiveCardMiddleware.js).

See a working sample of the [minimal Web Chat bundle](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/tree/master/samples/02.a.getting-started-minimal-bundle).

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <div id="webchat" role="main"></div>
    <script src="https://cdn.botframework.com/botframework-webchat/latest/webchat-minimal.js"></script>
    <script>
      window.WebChat.renderWebChat({
        directLine: window.WebChat.createDirectLine({ token: 'YOUR_DIRECT_LINE_TOKEN' }),
        userID: 'YOUR_USER_ID'
      }, document.getElementById('webchat'));
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Integrate with React

For full customizability, you can use React to recompose components of Web Chat.

To install the production build from NPM, run `npm install botframework-webchat`.

```jsx
import { DirectLine } from 'botframework-directlinejs';
import React from 'react';
import ReactWebChat from 'botframework-webchat';

export default class extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.directLine = new DirectLine({ token: 'YOUR_DIRECT_LINE_TOKEN' });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <ReactWebChat directLine={ this.directLine } userID="YOUR_USER_ID" />
      element
    );
  }
}
```

> You can also run `npm install botframework-webchat@master` to install a development build that is synced with Web Chat's GitHub `master` branch.

See a working sample of [Web Chat rendered via React](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/tree/master/samples/03.a.host-with-react/).

# Customize Web Chat UI

Web Chat is designed to be customizable without forking the source code. The table below outlines what kind of customizations you can achieve when you are importing Web Chat in different ways. This list is not exhaustive.

| | CDN bundle | React |
| - | - | - |
| Change colors | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Change sizes | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Update/replace CSS styles | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Listen to events | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Interact with hosting webpage | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Custom render activities | | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Custom render attachments | | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Add new UI components | | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Recompose the whole UI | | :heavy_check_mark: |

See more about [customizing Web Chat](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/blob/master/SAMPLES.md) to learn more on customization.

# Building the project

> If you need to build this project for customization purposes, we strongly advise you to refer to our [samples](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/tree/master/samples). If you cannot find any samples that fulfill your customization needs and you don't know how to do that, please [send your dream to us](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/issues/).
>
> Forking Web Chat to make your own customizations means you will lose access to our latest updates. Maintaining forks also introduces chores that are substantially more complicated than a version bump.

To build Web Chat, you will need to make sure both your Node.js and NPM is latest version (either LTS or current).

```sh
npm install
npm run bootstrap
npm run build
```

## Build tasks

There are 3 types of build tasks in the build process.

- `npm run build`: Build for development (instrumented code for code coverage)
   - Will bundle as `webchat-instrumented*.js`
- `npm run watch`: Build for development with watch mode loop
- `npm run prepublishOnly`: Build for production
   - Will bundle as `webchat*.js`

## Testing Web Chat for development purpose

We built a playground app for testing Web Chat so we can test certain Web Chat specific features.

```sh
cd packages/playground
npm start
```

Then browse to http://localhost:3000/, and click on one of the connection options on the upper right corner.

- Official MockBot: we hosted a live demo bot for testing Web Chat features
- Emulator Core: it will connect to http://localhost:5000/v3/directline for [emulated Direct Line service](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-Emulator/tree/master/packages/emulator/cli/)

You are also advised to test the CDN bundles by copying the test harness from our samples.

## Building CDN bundle in development mode

Currently, the standard build script does not build the CDN bundle (`webchat*.js`).

```sh
cd packages/bundle
npm run webpack-dev
```

> By default, this script will run in watch mode.

## Building CDN bundle in production mode

If you want to build a production CDN bundle with minification, you can follow these steps.

```sh
cd packages/bundle
npm run prepublishOnly
```

# Web Chat API Reference

There are several properties that you might pass into your Web Chat React Component (`<ReactWebChat>`) or the `renderWebChat()` method. Feel free to examine the source code starting with [`packages/component/src/Composer.js`](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/blob/master/packages/component/src/Composer.js#L378). Below is a short description of the available props.

| `groupTimeStamp`           | Change default settings for timestamp groupings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| `store`                    | Specify a custom store, e.g. for adding programmatic activity to the bot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `styleOptions`             | Object that stores customization values for your styling of Web Chat. For the complete list of (frequently updated) default style options, please see the [defaultStyleSetOptions.js](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/blob/master/packages/component/src/Styles/defaultStyleSetOptions.js) file.                      |
| `styleSet`                 | The non-recommended way of overriding styles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `userID`                   | Specify a userID. There are two ways to specify the `userID`: in props, or in the token when generating the token call (`createDirectLine()`). If both methods are used to specify the userID, the token userID property will be used, and a `console.warn` will appear during runtime. If the `userID` is provided via props but is prefixed with `'dl'`, e.g. `'dl_1234'`, the value will be thrown and a new `ID` generated. If `userID` is not specified, it will default to a random user ID. Multiple users sharing the same user ID is not recommended; their user state will be shared.                                                                                                                                                |
| `username`                 | Specify a username.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `webSpeechPonyFillFactory` | Specify the Web Speech object for text-to-speech and speech-to-text.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
