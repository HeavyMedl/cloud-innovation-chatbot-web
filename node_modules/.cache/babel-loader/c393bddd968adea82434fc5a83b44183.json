It is best used to delay tasks in time or to schedule tasks repeating\n * in intervals.\n *\n * If you just want to \"defer\" task, that is to perform it right after currently\n * executing synchronous code ends (commonly achieved by `setTimeout(deferredTask, 0)`),\n * better choice will be the {@link asap} scheduler.\n *\n * @example <caption>Use async scheduler to delay task</caption>\n * const task = () => console.log('it works!');\n *\n * Rx.Scheduler.async.schedule(task, 2000);\n *\n * // After 2 seconds logs:\n * // \"it works!\"\n *\n *\n * @example <caption>Use async scheduler to repeat task in intervals</caption>\n * function task(state) {\n *   console.log(state);\n *   this.schedule(state + 1, 1000); // `this` references currently executing Action,\n *                                   // which we reschedule with new state and delay\n * }\n *\n * Rx.Scheduler.async.schedule(task, 3000, 0);\n *\n * // Logs:\n * // 0 after 3s\n * // 1 after 4s\n * // 2 after 5s\n * // 3 after 6s\n *\n * @static true\n * @name async\n * @owner Scheduler\n */\n\n\nexports.async = new AsyncScheduler_1.AsyncScheduler(AsyncAction_1.AsyncAction);","map":null,"metadata":{},"sourceType":"script"}
